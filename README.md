# Transformer-based Recommendation Systems for Sequential Recommendation

This is the research project for COMP 5331, which focuses on Knowledge Discovery in Databases.

## Inspiration

The code is heavily inspired by the KDD 2023 paper [Text Is All You Need: Learning Language Representations for Sequential Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13731) and [Recformer](https://github.com/JiachengLi1995/Recformer) implementation.
